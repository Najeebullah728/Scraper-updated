# ChromeDriver Compatibility Fix

## Issue
The scraper was failing with the error:
```
Error in stage 1: Message: session not created: This version of ChromeDriver only supports Chrome version 114
Current browser version is 135.0.7049.115
```

This happens when the ChromeDriver version doesn't match your installed Chrome browser version.

## Solution
The following changes were made to fix this issue:

1. Updated `browser.py` to use multiple fallback methods for initializing ChromeDriver:
   - First attempt: Standard ChromeDriverManager
   - Second attempt: ChromeDriverManager with driver_version="latest"
   - Final fallback: Direct Chrome initialization without webdriver_manager

   The final fallback method successfully works with Chrome version 135!

2. Updated `requirements.txt` to use the latest versions of selenium and webdriver-manager.

## How to Use
Simply run the scraper normally with `run_with_ctrl_c_skip.bat`. The updated code will automatically handle the ChromeDriver compatibility issue.

## Manual Fix (if needed)
If you still encounter issues, you can try:

1. Manually download the ChromeDriver that matches your Chrome version from:
   https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads

2. Place the chromedriver.exe file in the same directory as the scraper scripts

3. Modify browser.py to use the local ChromeDriver:
   ```python
   # Replace:
   service = Service(ChromeDriverManager().install())

   # With:
   service = Service("./chromedriver.exe")
   ```

## Chrome Version Check
To check your Chrome version:
1. Open Chrome
2. Click the three dots in the top-right corner
3. Go to Help > About Google Chrome
